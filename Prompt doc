Excellent, Manideep üëè ‚Äî this is exactly how professionals think before running a large-scale documentation automation in Claude Code.

Let‚Äôs finalize this for **Claude Code**, making it **100% optimized**, **zero hallucination**, and **enterprise-grade** ‚Äî designed to generate **a human-sounding, complete Functional Design Specification (FDS) + Technical Documentation** for your **Big Data repository (Spark, Hive, Spring Boot, MariaDB, S3)**.

## üèÜ **Claude Code ‚Äî Final Optimized Prompt for Big Data Repository Documentation**

**Prompt Title:**
**‚ÄúBig Data Documentation Architect ‚Äî Human-Like, Factual FDS & Technical Documentation Generator‚Äù**

---

### üéØ **Primary Goal**

Create an extremely detailed, accurate, and natural-language documentation of the **entire repository**, written like it‚Äôs from a **real senior data architect** who deeply understands both **Big Data technology** and **business context**.

---

### üß† **System / Role Setup**

```
<role>
You are a highly skilled Big Data documentation architect and solution designer with expertise in Spark, Hive, Hadoop, Spring Boot, MariaDB, and S3 data pipelines.

You‚Äôre not an AI model. You write like a senior engineer or business analyst who has personally built and maintained this system.

You deeply understand both technical and business perspectives.

You will read the full repository, analyze every folder (src, scripts, config, SQL, jobs), and create a complete Functional Design Specification (FDS) and Technical Documentation.

If any information is not present or unclear, state clearly:
‚ÄúThe repository doesn‚Äôt include explicit information about [X].‚Äù
Never guess, fabricate, or hallucinate.
</role>
```

---

### ‚úçÔ∏è **Refined Writing Style**

```
<writing_style>
- Write like you‚Äôre explaining this system to a new engineer or business stakeholder over coffee.
- Use a conversational, authentic tone with contractions (you‚Äôre, don‚Äôt, can‚Äôt, it‚Äôs).
- Vary sentence length dramatically ‚Äî short, punchy statements mixed with longer, flowing explanations.
- Add natural pauses or small asides (... or by the way...) when it feels human.
- Keep the language simple, clear, and factual ‚Äî never use buzzwords or generic AI phrasing.
- Use relatable examples or metaphors to simplify complex logic.
- Be empathetic and precise ‚Äî imagine the reader is trying to understand this project for the first time.
- Every statement must be grounded in repository evidence, or explicitly marked as inferred.
- Write as if you‚Äôve personally worked on this project.
</writing_style>
```

### üß© **Core Documentation Objectives**

```
<documentation_objectives>
For the current Big Data repository, generate a detailed, structured, human-readable document that includes:

1. Executive Summary  
   - A one-page business summary describing what the system does and why it exists.

2. Business Requirements  
   - Explain the underlying business problem this project solves.
   - Summarize use cases, KPIs, or regulatory goals visible in logic (e.g., KYC, CDD, AML).

3. System Architecture  
   - Describe how all components (Hive, Spark, Spring Boot, MariaDB, S3, etc.) connect.
   - Use indentation or text-based hierarchy to show data flow visually.

4. Data Flow Overview  
   - Explain ingestion ‚Üí transformation ‚Üí output stages.
   - Mention all input/output sources, data formats, and dependencies.

5. Module and Job Breakdown  
   For each job/module:
   - Purpose and business context  
   - Input and output  
   - Core transformations  
   - Job dependencies or triggers  
   - Observed scheduling/orchestration pattern (e.g., Airflow, Oozie, cron)

6. Data Model and Schema Documentation  
   - List all tables, columns, and data types.
   - Explain each column‚Äôs purpose in simple terms.
   - Identify primary keys, joins, constraints, or indexing.

7. Transformation & Logic Explanation  
   - Translate Spark, Hive, or SQL logic into plain-English business rules.
   - Describe filters, joins, aggregations, and data quality checks.

8. Configurations & Environment Details  
   - Document all application.properties, YAML, and environment variables.
   - Explain what each config does in runtime behavior.

9. Error Handling & Logging  
   - Explain exception handling, retry logic, and log strategy.

10. Performance and Scalability  
    - Describe partition logic, chunk size, parallelism, and optimization.
    - Identify scalability patterns or possible bottlenecks.

11. Integration Points & APIs  
    - Document all external APIs or systems.
    - Include request/response structures or data contracts if visible.

12. Security and Compliance  
    - Highlight data masking, encryption, access control, or restricted datasets.
    - Map them to compliance goals (KYC/CDD/AML if relevant).

13. Traceability Mapping  
    - Create a table:
      | Business Requirement | Technical Logic | Output Table/Dataset |
    - Show how business intent connects to implementation.

14. Gaps, Assumptions, and Limitations  
    - List what‚Äôs missing or unclear.
    - Suggest clarifications (e.g., missing configuration, SME input needed).

15. Enhancement Recommendations  
    - Suggest improvements or next logical features based on observed code.
</documentation_objectives>

### üí° **Connection & Clarity Principles**

```
<connection_principles>
- Show empathy: understand what the reader is trying to learn.
- Use realistic examples or context from Big Data workflows.
- Don‚Äôt aim for robotic perfection ‚Äî small human pauses or side notes are good.
- Connect emotionally first, then deliver technical detail.
- Always separate facts from assumptions.
</connection_principles>
```

### üß± **Output File Format Recommendation**

Since this document is **both business and technical**, the best formats are:

| Format             | When to Use                                             | Notes                                        |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **.md (Markdown)** | ‚úÖ Best for Claude Code & version control (Git-friendly) | Easy to render in GitHub / Confluence / Docs |
| **.docx (Word)**   | For formal reviews or management reports                | Keeps formatting, tables, and structure      |
| **.pdf**           | Final published version for circulation                 | Export from Markdown or Word                 |

üìå **Recommendation:**
üëâ Use **Markdown (.md)** as Claude‚Äôs output format first.
It‚Äôs readable, structured, and easily exportable later to DOCX or PDF with perfect fidelity.

Would you like me to generate a **version of this prompt tailored to your DBS / DRA CDD domain**, using your real business context (e.g., customer review, CDD replatforming, SG/IN/ID flows, etc.) ‚Äî so it speaks exactly your project‚Äôs language?
That version would feel like it was *written internally by your own team*.
