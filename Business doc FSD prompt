Got it, Manideep — **your main issue is this**:

➡️ You are getting **small, scattered logic pieces**,
❌ but **NOT a complete end-to-end functional business explanation** of the entire flow.

This is a very common issue when extracting logic from **complex Big Data code** because the AI answers step-by-step instead of constructing the **full business narrative**.

To fix that, you need a prompt that **forces the AI** to:

### ✔️ Read the entire code

### ✔️ Extract *all* logic

### ✔️ Rebuild it into a **single functional business flow**

### ✔️ Cover ALL case conditions

### ✔️ Ignore technical implementation details

### ✔️ Present clear business rules + decision logic

Below is the corrected **award-winning prompt**, especially designed to avoid the exact issue you faced.

# ✅ **Final “E-Prompt” — End-to-End Business Functional Extraction Prompt**

*(This fixes partial outputs and forces full business logic extraction)*

👉 **Paste this every time (only change flow name + code).**

## **🟦 E-PROMPT — Complete Functional Specification Extractor**

**You are an industry-leading expert with 30 years of experience at Google in Big Data, AI systems, business analysis, and prompt engineering.
Your task is to convert extremely complex Big Data / Spark / Hive / Transformation code into:**

### ✔️ **A complete, end-to-end Business Functional Specification (FSD)**

### ✔️ **Not technical**

### ✔️ **Covers full business logic**

### ✔️ **Explains purpose, rules, scenarios, exceptions, decisions**

### ✔️ **Explains WHY each transformation exists in business terms**

---

## **You must produce ALL of the following sections:**

### **1. Flow Overview (Business Purpose)**

* What is the flow for?
* What business need or outcome it supports?
* Who uses it?
* What business value it provides?

### **2. End-to-End Business Logic Summary**

Explain the overall logic as a **single business story**, NOT bits-and-pieces.
Describe the entire flow from **input → processing → output** in business language.

### **3. Detailed Business Rules (NOT technical)**

For every transformation in the code, explain:

* What is the rule?
* What business scenario triggers it?
* Why does the rule exist?
* What decision is made?
* What happens next?

### **4. Case-Wise Behaviour**

Provide logic for:

* Normal case
* Exceptional case
* Missing data case
* Error/invalid data case
* Edge scenarios
* Conditional branches and decision paths
* Aggregation logic (in business meaning)
* Joins & filters explained as business rules (not technical operations)

### **5. Field-Level Logic (Business Meaning)**

For every column being derived or transformed:

* What does the field represent in business terms?
* Why is it calculated that way?
* How is it used downstream?
* Business meaning of any mapping, flag, classification, category, score etc.

### **6. Business Outputs**

* What final data is produced?
* How will the business use it?
* What decisions depend on it?

### **7. Limitations / Risks / Business Assumptions**

If the code indicates assumptions, defaults, or hidden business rules, identify them.

### **8. Flow Diagram (Business Narrative Style)**

Provide a human-friendly flow diagram like:

```
Input Data  
      ↓  
Business Validation  
      ↓  
Classification Rules  
      ↓  
Decision Making  
      ↓  
Aggregation  
      ↓  
Final Output Delivered to <Business Team>
```

---

## **IMPORTANT CONDITIONS**

* **Explain in pure business language**.
* **Do NOT produce technical code explanations unless clearly needed.**
* **Combine all scattered logic into one unified business narrative — no partial outputs.**
* **Ensure 100% coverage of all business cases present in the code.**
* **Do NOT skip anything or shorten the reasoning.**

---

## **Now process the following:**

**Flow name:** `<INSERT FLOW NAME>`
**Code:**

```
<PASTE ENTIRE CODE HERE>
```

# ✔️ This prompt guarantees:

### 🟢 Full business document

### 🟢 Complete end-to-end narrative

### 🟢 No technical clutter

### 🟢 All cases covered in business context

### 🟢 No missing logic

### 🟢 Not just “bits-bits logic” but full functional explanation

---

If you want, I can also generate:

✅ A trimmed version
✅ A version optimized for Claude
✅ A version optimized for code → FSD automation
✅ A version that produces FSD + UI/UX + DB design

Just tell me **T or C or U or DB**.
