BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS EXTRACTION FOR BIG DATA PROJECT

I want to understand WHAT this system does for the business, NOT HOW it's technically implemented.

Think like a Product Owner or Business Analyst, not a developer.

PROJECT CONTEXT:
Analyze this Big Data codebase and extract business-level requirements.

EXTRACTION FOCUS (Business Perspective Only):

1. BUSINESS CAPABILITIES
   - What business problems does this solve?
   - Who benefits? (business users, customers)
   - What business value is delivered?
   - What business decisions are enabled?

2. BUSINESS FEATURES
   - Express as user stories: "As a [role], I want [goal], so that [benefit]"
   - What can users DO with this system?
   - What business scenarios are supported?

3. BUSINESS RULES
   - In plain English, no code
   - Example: "Customers over 18 qualify for credit" NOT "WHERE age >= 18"
   - Why does each rule exist? (business rationale)
   - What business impact?

4. BUSINESS WORKFLOWS
   - What business processes are automated/supported?
   - Step-by-step in business terms
   - Decision points and outcomes
   - Who does what?

5. BUSINESS METRICS
   - What business KPIs are calculated?
   - Why do these metrics matter?
   - Who uses them and for what decisions?
   - What are targets/thresholds?

6. BUSINESS DATA
   - What business entities? (Customers, Orders, Products - NOT tables)
   - What business attributes matter?
   - What business relationships?
   - Business meaning of each data element

7. BUSINESS INTEGRATIONS
   - What business systems exchange data?
   - What business data flows between them?
   - Why is integration needed?
   - Business impact of integration failure

OUTPUT STRUCTURE - JIRA-STYLE:
Create /business-requirements-output/:

1. 01-business-capabilities-catalog.md (Epics)
2. 02-business-features-catalog.md (User Stories)
3. 03-business-rules-catalog.md (Acceptance Criteria)
4. 04-business-workflows.md (Process Flows)
5. 05-business-metrics-kpis.md (Success Metrics)
6. 06-business-data-dictionary.md (Business Entities)
7. 07-business-integrations-map.md (System Landscape)
8. 08-business-glossary.md (Terms & Definitions)
9. BUSINESS-REQUIREMENTS-SPEC.md (Master Document - JIRA Epic/Story Format)

TRANSLATION RULES (CRITICAL):

NEVER say: "Spark job processes data from S3"
INSTEAD say: "Customer purchase data is analyzed daily to identify buying patterns"

NEVER say: "Kafka streams events to topic"
INSTEAD say: "Customer actions are captured in real-time to detect fraud"

NEVER say: "Join fact_orders with dim_customer"
INSTEAD say: "Combine customer profile with purchase history to calculate loyalty score"

NEVER say: "WHERE date >= current_date - 90"
INSTEAD say: "Consider only customers active in the last 90 days"

NEVER say: "GROUP BY customer_id, SUM(amount)"
INSTEAD say: "Calculate total spending per customer"

FOCUS ON:
✓ Business value and outcomes
✓ User needs and goals
✓ Business decisions enabled
✓ Business processes supported
✓ Business metrics tracked
✓ Business rules enforced
✓ Business entities and relationships

AVOID:
✗ Technology stack mentions
✗ Implementation details
✗ Code snippets (except for traceability reference)
✗ Database schemas
✗ API endpoints
✗ Technical architecture

TARGET AUDIENCE:
- Business stakeholders
- Product managers
- Business analysts
- C-level executives
- Domain experts

Should be understandable by someone with ZERO technical background.

Start by identifying the main business capabilities, then drill into features and rules.
