Generate a production-ready Functional Specification Document (FSD) for an enterprise big data solution. Deliver as a single, professionally formatted markdown document suitable for executive review and technical implementation.

=== PROJECT PARAMETERS ===

Project Name: [Specify project name]
Business Domain: [e.g., Financial Analytics, Customer Intelligence, Supply Chain Optimization]
Technology Stack: [e.g., Apache Spark, Kafka, Airflow, Snowflake, AWS/Azure/GCP]
Data Scale: [Volume, velocity, variety - e.g., 50TB daily, real-time streaming]
Primary Stakeholders: Data Engineering, Enterprise Architecture, Business Analytics, QA, InfoSec

=== DOCUMENT STRUCTURE ===

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
   Objective: Articulate business value, strategic alignment, and expected ROI
   Content: Problem statement, proposed solution, success criteria, risk overview
   Length: 1-2 pages
   Include: High-level architecture visualization (Mermaid diagram preferred)

2. BUSINESS CONTEXT & REQUIREMENTS
   - Strategic drivers and business justification
   - Functional requirements mapped to business objectives
   - Stakeholder analysis and RACI matrix
   - Compliance and regulatory considerations

3. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
   - Conceptual architecture with component interactions
   - Data flow diagrams (end-to-end pipeline)
   - Technology selection rationale and alternatives considered
   - Integration patterns and API contracts
   - Scalability and performance architecture

4. DATA SPECIFICATIONS
   - Source system inventory (format, frequency, volume, ownership)
   - Target data model (logical and physical design principles)
   - Data mapping matrix (source-to-target transformations)
   - Data quality framework (validation rules, cleansing procedures, SLA thresholds)
   - Master data management and reference data strategy

5. TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
   - Processing logic and transformation rules
   - Batch and real-time processing specifications
   - Error handling and recovery procedures
   - Logging, monitoring, and alerting requirements
   - Performance benchmarks and optimization strategies

6. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
   - Availability and reliability targets (SLA definitions)
   - Security architecture (authentication, authorization, encryption, audit)
   - Disaster recovery and business continuity
   - Capacity planning and resource optimization
   - Compliance adherence (GDPR, HIPAA, SOX as applicable)

7. IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP
   - Phased delivery approach with milestones
   - Dependencies and critical path analysis
   - Resource allocation and team structure
   - Risk register with mitigation strategies
   - Change management and training plan

8. OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
   - Support model and runbook overview
   - Maintenance and upgrade procedures
   - Cost model and TCO analysis
   - Success metrics and KPI dashboard design

9. APPENDICES
   - Technical glossary
   - Reference architecture patterns
   - Sample data transformations (illustrative examples only)
   - Testing strategy summary

=== FORMATTING STANDARDS ===

- Use markdown with consistent heading hierarchy (## for sections, ### for subsections)
- Present tabular data in markdown tables (schemas, mappings, comparisons)
- Employ bullet points for lists; limit prose to essential narratives
- Include Mermaid diagrams for architecture and flows (no placeholder images)
- Code snippets: Include only when illustrating complex transformations (max 3 examples, <20 lines each)
- Length: Target 20-30 pages equivalent; prioritize depth over breadth

=== OPTIMIZATION DIRECTIVES ===

To ensure efficient token utilization:
- Focus on architectural decisions and business-critical specifications
- Use representative samples for schemas (10-15 key fields rather than exhaustive catalogs)
- Summarize standard practices; detail only custom or complex implementations
- Reference industry frameworks where applicable (TOGAF, DAMA-DMBOK)

If token limits are approached, prioritize sections 1-5 with full detail; provide executive summaries for sections 6-8 with notation "detailed specifications available upon request."

=== BIG DATA SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS ===

Address the following enterprise big data concerns:
- Data lineage and metadata management strategy
- Schema evolution and backward compatibility approach
- Incremental processing and change data capture mechanisms
- Cost optimization techniques (compute, storage, network)
- Data governance framework and stewardship model
- Observability and operational intelligence capabilities

=== PROJECT DETAILS ===

[Provide 3-5 sentences describing the specific initiative, including business problem, data sources, processing requirements, expected outcomes, and key constraints]

Generate the FSD adhering to enterprise documentation standards and technical rigor expected for executive and architect review.
