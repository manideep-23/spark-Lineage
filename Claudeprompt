Generate a complete Functional Specification Document (FSD) for a big data project in a single, well-structured markdown file.

PROJECT CONTEXT:
- Project Name: [Your Project Name]
- Domain: Big Data / Data Engineering
- Tech Stack: [e.g., Spark, Kafka, Airflow, Snowflake, AWS/Azure/GCP]
- Data Volume: [e.g., TB/PB scale, real-time/batch]
- Key Stakeholders: [Data Engineers, Architects, Business Analysts, QA]

DOCUMENT REQUIREMENTS:

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (1 page)
   - Business objective, scope, success metrics
   - High-level architecture diagram (ASCII/Mermaid)

2. SYSTEM OVERVIEW
   - Data sources (types, formats, frequency, volume)
   - Target systems and consumers
   - Integration points and dependencies

3. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
   - Data ingestion: methods, schedules, validation rules
   - Transformation logic: business rules, aggregations, cleansing
   - Storage: partitioning, retention, archival policies
   - Output: formats, delivery mechanisms, SLAs

4. TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE
   - Component diagram with data flow
   - Technology rationale (why each tool chosen)
   - Scalability and performance considerations

5. DATA SPECIFICATIONS
   - Source schema (sample: top 10 critical fields)
   - Target schema (sample: top 10 fields)
   - Mapping rules (source â†’ target transformations)
   - Data quality rules and thresholds

6. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
   - Performance: throughput, latency targets
   - Reliability: SLA, fault tolerance, disaster recovery
   - Security: encryption, access control, compliance (GDPR/HIPAA)
   - Monitoring: KPIs, alerting thresholds

7. IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
   - Phases with milestones (table format)
   - Risk matrix (top 5 risks with mitigation)
   - Resource requirements

8. APPENDICES
   - Glossary (big data terms)
   - Sample data flow (1 end-to-end example)
   - Testing strategy overview

OPTIMIZATION CONSTRAINTS:
- Use tables for schemas, mappings, and comparisons
- Use bullet points for lists (no verbose paragraphs)
- Include code snippets ONLY for critical transformation logic (max 3 examples, 15 lines each)
- Diagrams: ASCII art or Mermaid (no image placeholders)
- Page target: 15-25 pages equivalent
- Prioritize: What, Why, How (in that order)

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Single markdown file with clear section headers (##), subsection (###), and consistent formatting.

FOCUS AREAS FOR BIG DATA:
- Data lineage and governance
- Incremental processing strategies
- Schema evolution handling
- Cost optimization techniques
- Monitoring and observability

Now generate the FSD based on this template for: 

Generate FSD for my repo for sales margin module of EPMS . 

Expected Output: 18-22 page FSD covering all sections, ready for stakeholder review.
