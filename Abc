Excellent, Manideep 👏

Since you now want a **final curated list of 40 questions** that are:

* ❗For **L2 Big Data Support Engineers** (around 5–8 years exp)
* 🧠 **Not too deeply technical** (i.e., operational + scenario + troubleshooting focused)
* 🏗️ Real-world, practical, and conversation-style (not syntax-heavy or code-oriented)

This version is perfect for **interviewer panels**, **HR tech screening**, or **project lead evaluations** — where you want to assess the person’s **thinking, ownership, and production understanding** rather than deep developer coding.

# 🧩 FINAL SET — 40 PRACTICAL L2 BIG DATA SUPPORT INTERVIEW QUESTIONS

*(Not too technical, but strong in practical and RCA depth)*

---

## 🔹 SECTION 1: HDFS & CLUSTER BASICS (5)

**1.** What happens when one of the DataNodes in a Hadoop cluster goes down?

> *Expected:* Data replication handles fault tolerance automatically; HDFS re-replicates missing blocks.

**2.** How do you check if the HDFS cluster is healthy?

> *Expected:* `hdfs dfsadmin -report`, NameNode UI, or monitoring dashboards.

**3.** What steps do you take when the cluster goes into **safe mode**?

> *Expected:* Check disk usage, complete replication, exit safe mode once healthy.

**4.** What could cause HDFS space to fill up suddenly, and how would you identify the culprit?

> *Expected:* Temporary files, failed job logs, small files — use `du -sh` and `hdfs dfs -du -h`.

**5.** How would you handle “permission denied” while accessing HDFS paths?

> *Expected:* Check HDFS ACLs, file ownership, Kerberos ticket validity.

---

## 🔹 SECTION 2: HIVE OPERATIONS (5)

**6.** What’s the difference between an **Internal** and **External** Hive table?

> *Expected:* Internal → Hive owns data; External → data managed outside Hive.

**7.** How do you refresh metadata after new partitions are added in HDFS?

> *Expected:* Run `MSCK REPAIR TABLE` or `ALTER TABLE ADD PARTITION`.

**8.** What causes “NULL” values in Hive output when data exists in the file?

> *Expected:* Wrong delimiter, schema mismatch, or SerDe issue.

**9.** How would you check why a Hive query is running slowly?

> *Expected:* Review job stages, file format, skewed data, or large joins.

**10.** What happens when you drop an **External** table in Hive?

> *Expected:* Metadata removed; actual data in HDFS remains.

---

## 🔹 SECTION 3: SPARK / JOB EXECUTION (4)

**11.** Your Spark job failed due to `OutOfMemoryError`. What would you check first?

> *Expected:* Input size, skewed data, executor memory, or shuffle size.

**12.** How do you check the status or logs of a failed Spark job?

> *Expected:* Spark History Server, YARN Resource Manager UI, or `yarn logs -applicationId`.

**13.** What are some common reasons Spark jobs fail intermittently?

> *Expected:* Network latency, driver/executor failure, temporary resource shortage.

**14.** If a Spark job runs fine for small data but fails for larger input, what could be wrong?

> *Expected:* Insufficient memory, improper partitioning, or unoptimized joins.

---

## 🔹 SECTION 4: OOZIE / AIRFLOW JOBS (4)

**15.** How do you identify a failed Oozie workflow quickly?

> *Expected:* Oozie console, job logs, email alerts, or checking status via CLI.

**16.** What could cause an Oozie coordinator job to skip a day’s run?

> *Expected:* Missing input data, frequency mismatch, or late data availability.

**17.** How do you rerun only failed nodes in an Oozie workflow?

> *Expected:* Use `-rerun` option with failed node list.

**18.** How do you monitor Airflow DAG health daily?

> *Expected:* DAG run status, task failures, retry counts, SLA misses.

---

## 🔹 SECTION 5: DATA QUALITY & VALIDATION (3)

**19.** How do you validate data completeness after ingestion?

> *Expected:* Compare source vs. target record count; checksum; reconciliation tables.

**20.** How do you ensure partition-level data validation?

> *Expected:* Check partition counts, data ranges, and expected file counts.

**21.** How do you detect duplicates or missing records in Hive?

> *Expected:* Run `GROUP BY` and count check, or compare against control totals.

---

## 🔹 SECTION 6: MONITORING & RCA (5)

**22.** What tools do you use for cluster or job monitoring?

> *Expected:* Cloudera Manager, Ambari, Grafana, Kibana, CloudWatch.

**23.** What steps do you take when a P1 incident occurs in production?

> *Expected:* Acknowledge, analyze logs, check dependencies, escalate with RCA summary.

**24.** How do you differentiate between an application issue and an infrastructure issue?

> *Expected:* If failures are random → infra; consistent logic failure → app/config issue.

**25.** How do you find which jobs are consuming more resources?

> *Expected:* Check YARN Resource Manager, top apps in queue, or Cloudera metrics.

**26.** What is your approach to root cause analysis (RCA)?

> *Expected:* Define issue → collect logs → identify cause → implement fix → document preventive measure.

---

## 🔹 SECTION 7: CLOUD & STORAGE (3)

**27.** How do you integrate Hive tables with S3?

> *Expected:* Set S3 path as location and configure AWS credentials.

**28.** What causes access denied while writing to S3 bucket from Hadoop?

> *Expected:* IAM role missing permissions or bucket policy restrictions.

**29.** How do you ensure data is not partially written to S3 after job failure?

> *Expected:* Use temporary staging path, atomic rename, or checkpoint mechanism.

---

## 🔹 SECTION 8: LINUX & AUTOMATION (4)

**30.** What Linux commands do you use for checking logs or resource usage?

> *Expected:* `tail -f`, `grep`, `df -h`, `top`, `ps -ef`, `du -sh`.

**31.** How do you automate daily job health checks?

> *Expected:* Shell script scheduled via cron or Airflow; validate logs, row counts.

**32.** How do you identify which process is consuming most memory on a node?

> *Expected:* `top`, `ps aux --sort=-%mem`, or `free -m`.

**33.** How do you monitor disk space usage in Hadoop edge or data nodes?

> *Expected:* `df -h` on OS and `hdfs dfsadmin -report` for cluster.

---

## 🔹 SECTION 9: INCIDENT / PROCESS HANDLING (5)

**34.** What’s your approach when a downstream system reports missing data?

> *Expected:* Check if upstream jobs succeeded, partitions loaded, data paths valid.

**35.** What information do you capture before raising a P1 ticket?

> *Expected:* Job name, time, error snippet, logs, impacted systems, and steps tried.

**36.** How do you handle recurring production issues?

> *Expected:* Maintain RCA tracker, automate detection, escalate pattern to L3.

**37.** How do you ensure smooth handover between shifts?

> *Expected:* Maintain daily shift log, update ticket status, pending actions summary.

**38.** What’s the most common cause of SLAs being missed, and how do you prevent it?

> *Expected:* Job delays, upstream dependency, resource shortage; fix via retries and monitoring alerts.

---

## 🔹 SECTION 10: GENERAL & BEHAVIORAL (2)

**39.** How do you prioritize incidents during high workload periods?

> *Expected:* Based on severity (P1–P4), business impact, SLA, and dependency chain.

**40.** What do you think differentiates an L2 engineer from L1 and L3 roles?

> *Expected:* L2 focuses on RCA, automation, and coordination between L1 ops and L3 devs.
