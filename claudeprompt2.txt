Review the generated Big Data FDS and validate:

COMPLETENESS CHECK:
□ All data pipelines documented?
□ All data sources identified?
□ All data sinks documented?
□ All transformation logic extracted?
□ All business metrics cataloged?
□ All data quality rules captured?
□ All schemas documented (all layers)?
□ Data lineage complete?
□ All integrations mapped?
□ Monitoring and alerting rules documented?

ACCURACY CHECK:
□ Cross-verify transformation rules against actual code
□ Validate data lineage by tracing sample fields
□ Confirm pipeline schedules match configuration
□ Verify business metric formulas
□ Check schema accuracy against actual data

TRACEABILITY CHECK:
□ Every transformation has code reference?
□ Every business rule linked to implementation?
□ Every metric has calculation location?
□ Pipeline dependencies are complete?

BIG DATA SPECIFIC CHECK:
□ Partitioning strategies explained?
□ Performance optimizations documented?
□ Scalability considerations captured?
□ Resource allocation logic documented?
□ Incremental processing logic clear?
□ Data retention policies documented?
□ Disaster recovery procedures included?

CLARITY CHECK:
□ Business stakeholders can understand the purpose?
□ Data flow is visualized clearly?
□ Technical jargon is explained?
□ Business impact is clear for each component?
